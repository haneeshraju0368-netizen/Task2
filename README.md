In this internship project, you'll get a beginner-friendly introduction to the core activities of a Security Operations Center (SOC). Your main role will be to monitor security alerts, analyze potential threats, and simulate incident response — just like a SOC analyst in a real company.

This project simulates what SOC teams do 24/7 to keep organizations safe from cyberattacks by detecting suspicious activities early and responding quickly.
